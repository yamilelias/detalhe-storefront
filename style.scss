This theme was based on WooCommerce Storefront, so the next documentation is from it. This theme mantains the same license like the Storefront theme.

This theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL.
Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you've learned with others.

Storefront is based on Underscores http://underscores.me/, (C) 2012-2014 Automattic, Inc.

Resetting and rebuilding styles have been helped along thanks to the fine work of
Eric Meyer http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/index.html
along with Nicolas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/

All sizing (typography, layout, padding/margins etc) are inspired by a modular scale that uses 1em as a base size with a 1.618 ratio.
You can read more about the calculator we use in our sass here; https://github.com/modularscale/modularscale-sass
